1. it depends on our need of the order of execution,
we sometimes might want to use setImmediate instead of SetTimeout if
we want the callback to run immeadiatley after IO event`s callbacks.

2.if we use process.nexttick the function is stored in a priority queue which means after the V8 is free the that function will have first priority to be executed.
while setimmediate is stored in a regular queue which means it will be executed as its order in event loop.
process.nextTick is unique in that it is not part of the event loop,it 
is processed after current operation completes and before event loop continues(including setImmediate).
setImmediate on the other hand is part of the event loop and runs on the check phase of the event loop
after IO event`s callbacks.
